“I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch – hay fever, I fancy it was. 
I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases,
generally. I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into – some fearful, devastating scourge, I know – and, before I had glanced half down 
the list of “premonitory symptoms,” it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.

...

I had walked into that reading-room a happy, healthy man. I crawled out a decrepit wreck."

Jerome K. Jerome
