“I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch – hay fever, I fancy it was. 
I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases,
generally. I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into – some fearful, devastating scourge, I know – and, before I had glanced half down 
the list of “premonitory symptoms,” it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.

...

I had walked into that reading-room a happy, healthy man. I crawled out a decrepit wreck."

Jerome K. Jerome

Deep into that darkness peering,

Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,

Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals

Ever dared to dream before;

But the silence was unbroken,

And the stillness gave no token,

And the only word there spoken

Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"

This I whispered, and an echo

Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"

Merely this, and nothing more.

Edgar Allen Poe
